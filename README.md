> MLTSHP in Vue

Welcome to MLTSHP in Vue! I'm slowly doing my best to recreate MLTSHP.com using Vue.js. This is mostly an excuse for me to practice real-world JS skills like authentication, API calls, and how to interact with Vuex.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
