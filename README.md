> MLTSHP in Vue

Welcome to MLTSHP in Vue! I'm slowly doing my best to recreate MLTSHP.com using Vue.js. This is mostly an excuse for me to practice real-world JS skills like authentication, API calls, and how to interact with Vuex.

Note that this site is read-only at the moment. On the roadmap at the moment is the ability to upload an image, like a post, save a post, and make a comment.

There's also no styles. That will probably come alongside an effort to create a MLTSHP pattern library, which would be shared between this project and (hopefully) MLTSHP.com as an npm module.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
