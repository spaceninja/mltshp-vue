> MLTSHP in Vue

Welcome to MLTSHP in Vue! I'm doing my best to recreate [MLTSHP.com](https://mltshp.com/) using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) consuming the public [MLTSHP API](https://mltshp.com/developers).

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

Check out the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) for more information.
